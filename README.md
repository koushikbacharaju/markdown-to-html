# Markdown to HTML Viewer. This is a simple, single-file web application designed to render Markdown content from an `input.md` file into a styled HTML page using [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). ## Features: - **Markdown Rendering**: Converts `input.md` into beautiful HTML. - **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive layout. - **Single-File Application**: All necessary code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is contained within `index.html`. - **Easy to Use**: Just place `index.html` and `input.md` in the same directory and open `index.html` in your browser. ## Setup and Usage: 1. **Save the files**: Ensure `index.html` and your Markdown file, named `input.md`, are in the same directory. 2. **Open in browser**: Open `index.html` with your web browser. 3. **View Content**: The content of `input.md` will be automatically fetched, converted to HTML, and displayed on the page. ## Technologies Used: - **HTML5**: Structure of the web page. - **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling and modern UI components. - **Marked.js**: A JavaScript library for parsing Markdown to HTML. ## Customization: You can easily customize the look and feel by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes within the `<style>` block in `index.html`. The `input.md` file can be replaced with any Markdown content you wish to display.
